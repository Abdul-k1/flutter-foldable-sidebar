## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

I came across this project on Medium which was written by Shaiq Khan.

In this blog, he talked about how to use the Flutter foldable package to create a foldable sidebar 

menu. Link to his medium post is below.

My own addition to this project was to develop the individual pages of the project 

by making use of the ListView widget to display images and texts on the pages and also making use of the 

Elevated Button Widget and Routes to navigate back to the homepage.

You can check this repo out and see what you can add to this awesome project.
